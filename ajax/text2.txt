CV Tips

Your CV is your personal brochure, giving you a chance to show off all the attributes that make you the perfect choice for employers.

These tips show you the key things you need to consider to make sure your CV shows you in the best light.

1. Show what makes you unique 
For every job you apply for you could be up against hundreds of other candidates, so you need to make sure you stand out. Employers don't just buy skills, they buy solutions, so show how can you make the company money and how can you resolve the problems that they have.

2. Choose a clear layout 
Employers spend around 20 to 30 seconds scanning your CV, so it needs to remain clutter-free and easy to read. The last thing a recruiter wants to do is to go hunting for the information that they are looking for so don't hide it amongst an array of elaborate graphics.

3. Tailor your CV to your audience
It may sound like a time-consuming process, but making the effort to tailor your CV to suit the requirements of each particular job that you are applying for can greatly increase your chances of securing an interview.

4. Keep it error free
It's deceptively easy to make mistakes on your CV and exceptionally difficult to repair the damage once an employer gets it. As well as checking your spelling and grammar, make sure your employment dates match up and that you've provided the right phone number and email address.

5. Keep your CV up-to-date 
When you put together a CV it's often difficult remembering the projects you have been involved with and the achievements you have made. To avoid missing important pieces of information out, revisit your CV every month adding anything of importance and cut any information that is no longer required.
